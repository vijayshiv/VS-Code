"Mozambique - Beira Transport Corridor, Maputo Corridor Revitalization Technical Assistance, and Road and Coastal Shipping Projects","The audit largely concurs with the Implementation Completion Reports' ratings of satisfactory outcomes, and likely sustainability of the Beira Transport Corridor, Maputo Corridor Revitalization Technical Assistance, and the Road and Coastal Shipping Projects, as well as on substantial institutional development impacts, except that for the Maputo Corridor Project, which is rated as high. Experience with these projects confirms the following lessons. First, privatization is a learning process, a complex undertaking, as well as a foreign concept in official circles in developing, and transition economies; thus, exposure to early success stories in the country, or outside is crucial. Second, the particular private sector participation option is determined by the government's political readiness. While some reforms are better suited than others at improving the transport sector, and eliciting maximum private investment, the reform option adopted depends on the government's will, and readiness for such particular reform option, as well as on its capacity to pursue it. Third, negotiations between the conceding authority, and preferred bidder can improve the terms of concession, when response from competitive tendering is inadequate. Interestingly, regardless of the inappropriateness of ex-post negotiations given the potential vulnerability to unfairness, in light of few bidders in the tendering process, such as the Maputo port concession, prudent negotiations may prove beneficial to achieve advantageous concession terms, and minimize the monopoly of potential concessionaires.",Project Performance Assessment Report,Mozambique,Reports,"June 27, 2001",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/320031511185826983/pdf/multi0page.pdf
Pakistan - Hill Farming Technical Development Project,"The Hill Farming Technical Development Project in Pakistan was accomplished. Despite the slow startup, the project eventually achieved most of its goals. The Bank played an important role in meeting Pakistan's resource requirements for irrigation development. The International Development Association (IDA) performance was good. They provided necessary guidance through various review and technical missions during the period of implementation. The Bank carried out sixteen regular supervision missions and three technical missions, Continuity of supervision staff was reasonably well maintained, despite the prolonged implementation period. Problem areas were delayed in starting the project; contract packaging, contractor selection and management, which led to considerable delay in project implementation; and taking over and operation of drainage tubewells by the Punjab Irrigation Department (PID). The Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) was assisted by project consultants in the preparation of final project designs, tenders, award of contracts, and construction supervision.

Zimbabwe - Family Health Project,"Consistent with the findings in the Project Completion Report (PCR), ratings for the Zimbabwe - Family Health Project were as follows: The project was rated as satisfactory, institutional development as substantial, and sustainability as likely. Some lessons learned include: During preparation for the audit, three issues were identified for attention: decentralization, costs and donor coordination. Although the project supports the decentralization of services, the question of what decentralization meant, and the precise relationships at the community level between various ministries, was not clearly identified in the project documents at appraisal, and relationships have evolved since that time. Difficulties attributable to the challenge of creating effective interagency relationships in the name of achieving project goals are evident in this project. For example, the strengthening of community level services was also negatively affected by the transfer of Village Health Workers (VHW) to the Ministry of Cooperatives, Community Development and Women's Affairs. The serious cost overruns in this project -- for civil works and for equipment -- indicate the importance of paying close attention to the bread and butter matters of design, tendering, procurement and maintenance. The main positive outcome of the cost overruns is the firm way in which the Ministry of Health (MOH) has realized that this must be avoided in future. One lesson drawn is the need for greater flexibility in the design of district hospitals. Finally, the development of a more proactive stance toward donor coordination on the part of the MOH, and reports of growing satisfaction with this approach among several donors, reinforces the lesson that greater ownership can increase the effectiveness of external resources for health activities.",Project Performance Assessment Report,Zimbabwe,Reports,"August 13, 1996",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/385731468167977419/pdf/multi0page.pdf

The CAS was jointly implemented by IDA, IFC and MIGA, and this review covers the joint program of the three institutions. The original CAS period was extended to FY2009 to align with the one-year extension of government's Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS). The CAS sought primarily to contribute to the EDPRS objective of significantly raising growth and creating jobs. A secondary objective was to consolidate specific elements of Rwanda's recent social progress by tackling selected aspects of social vulnerability. To this end the CAS was framed around two strategic themes and five CAS objectives. Strategic Theme 1 aimed to support sustained growth by focusing on four key objectives, (i) agricultural production sustainably raised; (ii) improved access to and quality of key infrastructure services; (iii) improved environment for sound private sector development; and (iv) capacity to manage public resources strengthened at central and local levels. Strategic Theme 2 aimed (i) to attain child and maternal mortality goals; and (ii) to promote peace and social cohesion through demobilization and reintegration. IEG rates the overall outcome of WBG support as Satisfactory. Under Pillar 1, production of food crops increased, including an increase in the production of rice in targeted areas by 113 percent. Access to and quality of key infrastructure services improved, including for paved roads and electric power. The environment for private sector development improved, including in the financial sector. The primary school pupil to qualified teacher ratio was reduced, and the transition from basic education to upper secondary education was raised. The capacity to manage public resources at the central and local levels was also strengthened. Under Pillar 2, significant health and social risks to vulnerable groups and to social cohesion in Rwanda were mitigated, including with increases in assisted births in accredited health facilities, and reinsertion and/or reintegration support for former armed group members. The review agrees with the findings, conclusions, and lessons provided in the CASCR, including (i) a highly selective program helped to focus the design of the CAS in key strategic areas where the WBG would add value; (ii) use of general budget support was effective in a number of ways but is vulnerable to donor sentiments; (iii) the importance of capacity building for program design and implementation; (iv) a number of products were delivered as one WBG, and this helped create synergy within the institution and yielded benefits for the client; (v) much of project implementation support was decentralized and this could ensure a constant implementation pace; (vi) the CAS had a results framework focusing on key indicators; and (vii) stakeholder engagement is essential to enhance results and outcomes. In addition, this review would emphasize that (i) overall, Rwanda's development experience during this and the previous CAS periods, has been impressive, including rapid economic growth, improving social indicators, and declining economic inequality. IDA has made positive and constructive contributions to this substantial progress; (ii) high aid dependence as for Rwanda can represent a risk for a country's development program, and, thus, also for the success of the related Bank programs; (iii) even strong improvements in investment climate indicators may not lead to early results in terms of an investment response; and (iv) Bank program selectivity is easier when the country has clear ideas of the areas in which it wants the Bank to concentrate its support.",CAS Completion Report Reviews,Rwanda,Reports,"May 21, 2014",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/350121468305662189/pdf/Rwanda-Country-Assistance-Strategy-progress-report-CPSCR-and-completion-report-CASCR-review-for-the-period-FY09-12-IEG-review.pdf
Indonesia - Country partnership strategy for the period FY09-FY12 : IEG CPSCR review,"This review examines the implementation of the Indonesia Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of FY09 and the CPS Progress Report (CPSPR) of FY11, and reviews the draft CPS Completion Report (CPSCR). This review covers the joint program of the World Bank and the International Finance Croproation (IFC). The broad objective of the CPS was to promote the effectiveness of institutions for achieving stronger development outcomes. It called for engagement in five core areas: private sector development; infrastructure; community development and social protection; education; and environmental sustainability and disaster mitigation. IEG rates the overall outcome of the CPS program as moderately satisfactory, below the CPSCR rating of satisfactor.",CAS Completion Report Reviews,Indonesia,Reports,"November 30, 2012",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/975601468038719573/pdf/NonAsciiFileName0.pdf
